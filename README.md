# My-Python-Journey
Learning materials and practice from Python course.

Currently, I am expanding my skills by taking two courses simultaneously: Python MOOC from the University of Helsinki and a comprehensive course by itProger. This repository primarily documents my progress and solutions for the MOOC modules.

Part 1: Foundations

Getting started: Initial environment setup and basic syntax.
Info
More about variables: Handling strings, integers, and floating-point numbers.
Arithmetic operations: Performing calculations and using mathematical operators.
Conditional statements: Basic decision-making with if, else, and elif.

Part 2: Logic and Iteration

Programming terminology: Understanding core coding concepts and best practices.
More conditionals: Nested structures and advanced branching logic.
Combining conditions: Utilizing logical operators (and, or, not).
Simple loops: Implementing while loops for repetitive tasks and basic flow control.

Part 3: Functions and Modularity

Defining Functions: In this section, I explored the power of code reusability and modular design.
Learning Objectives:
    - Writing and calling custom functions using the `def` keyword.
    - Understanding the distinction between **parameters** (defined in the function) and **arguments** (passed during the call).
    - Defining and managing multiple parameters to create flexible logic.
Key Projects:
    - `Chessboard`: Implementing alternating patterns using conditional logic within loops.
    -  `Squared`: Developing a "sliding window" algorithm for dynamic string slicing.

Part 4: Data Structures and Efficiency

In this section, I delved into managing data collections and enhancing program structure through advanced function features and list manipulation.
Learning Objectives:
    - Advanced Functions: Mastering `return` values and using helper functions to break down complex problems (decomposition).
    - List Manipulation: Dynamic data storage using `.append()`, and statistical analysis with `.count()` and `sum()`.
    - Iteration Mastery: Using `for` loops with the `range()` function for both incremental and decremental (reverse) sequences.
    - Output Formatting: Implementing f-strings with precision specifiers (e.g., `:.1f`) and using string multiplication for simple data visualization.
Key Projects:
- `Grade Statistics`: A comprehensive tool that processes exam results, calculates weighted averages/pass percentages, and visualizes grade distribution via a text-based histogram.
